Currently the project is working as intended. With the help of the groupmates i was able
to formulate the constraints or "Data" in the project and build a shedule around it.
Used genetic algorithm aproach since someone else already used CSP to accomplish it, should
be more efficient however sufficient testing has not been done to confirm.Last second 
modification was made to keep mutating untill a 0 conflict sollution was achieved. 
Practically meaning the right solution, also idicated by 100% fitness value.
